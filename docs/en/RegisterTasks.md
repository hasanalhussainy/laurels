# Registering Tasks

1. Use The Laurel dApp
2. Go to the `Register Task` section.
3. Choose the laurel type 
4. Type in the amount. You need to multiply with 1000 the number of laurels that you want to assign to the task. E.g. for `10` laurels, it will be `10000`. You will see the intended laurels amount being filled in as `[Coding-10]` below (before the task title input).
5. A task must have a GitHub issue assigned. Use this dApp to create the issue. But if a GitHub issue was already created, select it from the dropdown and go to step 7.
6. To create the GitHub issue: fill in the title in the input and write a short description in the textarea. Then, click on `create`. You should see a link to the created issue appear in the UI.
7. Now you should have all fields filled in for registering the task on-chain. Click on `registerTask` to send the transaction. Your browser wallet (e.g. Metamask) should open and you must click to Confirm the transaction.
8. If everything was ok, you will see messages in our #monitor Discord channel for the task registration.
