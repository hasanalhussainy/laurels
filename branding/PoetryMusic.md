## The Laurel Hymn 

Our Calling
(The transcendental Hymn of The Laurel Project)
Imagine this music (the instrumental part)
https://youtu.be/s7LBDdckoH8
with the following words:

```
Our call's for your calling
of clear-blue and all-compelling
wing carved in the high of sky 
where the star-light meets the I 

If it's light you cannot choke it
if it's time you cannot top it
if it's thought you cannot cut it

We are Laureates
We are Laureates like mountains
We are Laureates like torches
We are Laureates like Caesar
We are Laureates

We are calling with a calling
for the history unrolling
the stairways of sky
where the temples touch the I 

We are whispering the calling
for the summon of the roaring
of deep-blue to unify
all of I with I and I.
```
